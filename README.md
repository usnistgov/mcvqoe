# Summary
The purpose of this software is to make quality of expirence (QoE) measurements 
for push-to-talk (PTT) communications systems. This Python package develoved by NISTâ€™s PSCR division contains a 
GUI for making these measurements. This GUI is the recommended way to run the 
following QoE measurements:

* [mouth 2 ear latency](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2018/NIST.IR.8206.pdf)
* [Access Time](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2019/NIST.IR.8275.pdf)
* Probability of Successful Delivery
* [Intelligibility](https://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/publications/download/Voran-ICASSP17.pdf)
* [Transmit Volume Optomization](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.TN.2171)



# MCV-QoE-GUI Python Package

The `mcvqoe` GUI package depends on the following other PSCR published packages:

* <https://github.com/usnistgov/mcvqoe-base>
* <https://github.com/usnistgov/abcmrt16>
* <https://github.com/usnistgov/mouth2ear>
* <https://github.com/usnistgov/accessTime>
* <https://github.com/usnistgov/psud>
* <https://github.com/usnistgov/intelligibility>
* <https://github.com/usnistgov/MCV-QOE-TVO>

In addition the following dependencies can be found in the Python Package index (PyPI) and will 
be downloaded automatically, if needed, when `mcvqoe` is installed:

* numpy
* pandas
* dash
* flask
* plotly
* requests
* pillow

To install the package run the following:
```
pip install mcvqoe
```
This is the easiest way to install all MCV QoE measurement software, as all the above packages are dependencies, and will be installed via PyPI.

Alternatively, one could clone this repository and run the following from the 
root of the git repository:

```
pip install .
```

## Running with terminal output

On windows, the GUI entry point, `mcvqoe` causes all console output from the GUI 
to be lost (on windows). If the input is desired on windows the GUI can also be 
run with the following:

```
python -m mcvqoe.hub
```

## Evaluation GUI

Data can be evaluated by using the Process Data menu from the GUI. Here users can select data they wish to process and a separate, browser-based interface will initialize.
